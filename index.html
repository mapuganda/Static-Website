                                <h3>Project Description</h3> 
                                <p> HOT is part of the global consortium STOP Spill over that is engaging local and national partners across multiple countries to develop initiatives that can contribute to cartelling the likelihood of zoonotic diseases spreading from animals to human beings. <br><br>In Uganda, the STOPS team is working in and around communities close to National game parks and reserves especially in the district of Bundibugyo. With the Semuliki National Park in the North and Rwenzori National Park in the South, Bundibugyo district is built between two very biopic national parks with a variety of wildlife moving across. The Population and economic activity within the district is also on the rise with over 80% of the population relying on agriculture to have an income.This brings about an increase in wildlife and human interactions especially in the rural settings of the district. <br><br> For this project, OSM Uganda (Sub-Contracted by HOT) was to support the consortium to understand the spatial interactions between bats and humans in the hot spot targets. This involved mapping all major human infrastructure interactions like <b>schools, health centers, playgrounds, gardens, caves, tourist sites, roads, offices and homes</b>. Major bat nesting areas in and around the interaction sites was also mapped under this project with the guidance and support of the STOPS country Team.<br><br> The data collected was then used to create map products that will assist the STOPS team have an informed understanding of the human and bat interaction in the 3 Sub Counties of Bundibugyo district.</p>

                                <h3> Actual Works </h3>
                                <p>Under this assignment, OpenStreetMap Uganda, subcontracted by HOT, worked on the data collection and validation exercise of infrastructure in Bundibugyo district. This included collection of all human infrastructure interaction interfaces (point of interest including schools, health facilities, agricultural gardens, businesses etc) with Bats in the 3 hotspot sub-counties (Harugale, Ntandi TC, Burundo) in Bundibugyo district. <br><br>OSM Uganda further mapped the other 17 sub-counties to provide up-to-date maps to the communities of  Bundibugyo district and its leadership  to support informed planning decisions for the district.<br><br> Furthermore,
                                <ul>
                                      <li>On completion of data cleaning, data was uploaded to the OpenStreetMap platform.</li><br>

                                <p>OpenStreetMap Uganda working with the Minority Rights Group, supported on the geospatial mapping for land conflict resolution of the Mosopisyek ancestral territory of the Benet people. <br>The project of mapping for the Mosopisyek ancestral territory of the Benet people was completed in two phases. The first phase was the Priority Maps, which was a short-term project to provide basic maps for the Mosopisyek people in order to help them to assert their rights and gain recognition for their ancestral territory. In this phase, the following maps were created:</p>
                                 <ul>
                                    <li>Perimeter & Sub-Territory Boundaries for MOSOP</li>
                                    <li>Administrative Boundaries Overlapping Mount Elgon National Park and MOSOP Territory</li>
                                    <li>Human Settlement in MOSOP Territory</li>
                                    <li>Preliminary Map of MOSOP Customary Uses of their Ancestral Homeland</li>
                                    <li>Proposed Community Protected Areas</li>
                                 </ul>

                                <p>The second phase was the Additional Maps which was a long-term project to provide more detailed maps for the Mosopisyek people in order to help them to assert their rights and gain recognition for their ancestral territory. In this phase, the following maps were created:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                    <li>Customary Land Use Maps.</li>
                                    <li>Four Sub-Territory Maps showing the above</li>
                                    <li>Four Sub-Territory Maps showing the historical clan areas within each</li>
                                    <li>Recognition of Land and Resource Rights Maps.</li>
                                </ul>    

                            <p>The maps were created using a combination of satellite imagery, GPS readings taken on-site (Features location) on Mount Elgon, and data collected from Mosopisyek elders and other stakeholders. In the process, 10 elders and leaders with smartphones were also trained and supported in the mapping and taking GPS readings reliably and keeping matching descriptive naming and other notes for each reading.</p> <img src="images/Areas_sites_subject_special_protection_under_mosopisyek.jpg" alt="Areas and sites subject for special protection under the mosopyek"> <h6><i>Areas and Sites subject for special protection under the Mosopyek.</i></h6>

                                <p>
                                    Uganda has a high youth population. Digital literacy has become an essential skill for young people to possess in today's society. However, many students in rural areas of Uganda lack access to the necessary tools and resources to develop their digital skills. This is where OpenStreetMap Uganda's proposed project comes in, aimed at promoting digital literacy in Uganda through geospatial mapping and leveraging the existing pool of PC-Laptops. 
                                    <br><br>The project aimed to address the lack of access to ICT tools and resources which is a primary challenge in <b>fostering quality education</b>, especially in rural areas. The project aimed to address this challenge by providing ICT tools and learning materials to schools through a <b>shared basis model</b> combined with applying <b>geospatial</b> learning techniques.
                                    <br><br>The activities to achieve the project objectives included:-
                                      <ul> 
                                           <li>Leveraging the OpenStreetMap Uganda’s existing ICT tools (PC-Laptops)</li>
                                           <li>The development of learning materials on geospatial mapping and digital literacy</li>
                                           <li>The training of teachers and students on the use of ICT tools and geospatial mapping.</li>
                                           <li>The conduction  of workshops on the use of geospatial mapping for community development and empowerment.</li>
                                      </ul>

                                    The project was implemented in partnership with schools in different regions of Uganda to provide access to ICT resources and training that will enable students to develop their digital skills.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Students and teachers contributed geospatial data via the OSM platform that included; schools, roads, buildings among others were added on the map. This data that the project generated is being used in different ways by:

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The local governments and authorities use the collected geospatial data to improve their urban planning and management.</li>
                                        <li>The schools and universities use the data to enhance their research and educational activities.</li>  
                                        <li>Partners like MySchool Today, are using the geospatial data to update the global schools map.</li>
                                        <li>The students and teachers use the geospatial data to further their personal and professional development.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    The OSM in School project is a component of the Africa Digital Access Initiative which is an on going program.

                                <p>Reliable demand estimation is a key parameter to electrification planning as well as the prioritization and  design of access programs to promote the productive use of energy (Banerjee et al, 2017). Demand  estimation analytics can help scale up the efforts to stimulate the productive use of electricity in the  agriculture sector. Prioritizing electrification by considering areas with existing or potentially high levels  of agricultural production and related energy demand may help,

                                    <li>Improve the financial viability of  access expansion through higher revenues for the utility.</li>
                                    <li>Deliver greater economic benefits from  electrification to rural areas.</li>
                                </ul>

                                The global knowledge and evidence generated by this agricultural demand estimation and modeling  exercise could be then used to replicate successful approaches throughout the World Bank energy access  portfolio, and the findings from the work will be disseminated to further global knowledge and encourage  further studies or activities in this area. Uganda as of the countries for the pilot has been identified as it  has opportunities for large-scale electricity demand interventions.<br><br>

                                The agricultural sector employs over 72% of the workforce; the potential for value addition and  mechanization of Uganda’s agricultural sector is low. For instance, more than 95% of farmers rely on  human power for their farming activities (UBOS) and less than 1% of the land is irrigated (WB, 2013).  Evidence suggests energy in agriculture increases farmers’ yield and income. For instance, 47 maize  shellers in the Busoga region in Uganda doubled local farmers’ incomes in 3 years. Providing electricity to  farmers that grow coffee, maize and beans, resulting in an annual income increase of 50% based on a  cost-benefit analysis for Kapchorwa, in rural eastern Uganda.<br>
                                This study aims to 
                              <ul>
                                <li>Estimate electricity demand from the agriculture sector including irrigation and  agro-processing.</li>
                                <li>Assess the opportunities and challenges to realize the potential electricity demand  from the agriculture sector in Uganda.</li>
                              </ul>

                                 For the national electricity demand estimation from agriculture activities, the approach would leverage various <b>geospatial data</b> as well as the data through the survey  approach. In addition, the project will utilize an existing World Bank operation in Uganda – Agriculture  Cluster Development Project (ACDP)(P145037). ACDP project supports activities and investments (termed  as ‘matching grants’) designed to raise both productivity and overall production of five priority crops - maize, beans, cassava, rice, and coffee in 12 selected high-potential agricultural areas in Uganda termed  <b>“clusters.”</b>

Thus, specifically the partnership is aimed at:
                                    <ul>
                                      <li>Piloting sustainable blue-green infrastructure and innovative grey solutions to solid waste in drainage channels across specific locations to mitigate flooding, and safeguard jobs and investments.</li><br>
                                      <li>Enhancing community and private sector engagement in flood control and stormwater management.</li>

                                <h3>Actual Works</h3>

                                    Under this assignment, OpenStreetMap Uganda developed a data collection platform ensuring that all cross-sections and drains had unique identifications. Mapped the drain cross-sections, the culvert/bridge dimensions and locations. The mapping consisted of recording the channel, culvert and bridge cross-sections where water should flow through using a high-accuracy global position system. For the channel cross-sections the mapped information included:
                                    <ul>
                                      <li>Ground/bed level position (XYZ) at approximately one meter increments along a linear transect perpendicular to the flow direction.</li><br>
                                      <li>The transect (also called a cross-section),  started at the top of the channel bank and proceeded to the top of the opposite bank.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                <h3>Project Description</h3>
                                <p>With the wide network of volunteers across Uganda, OpenStreetMap Uganda collaborated with Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team and <a href="https://www.fieldready.org/post/working-together-to-protect-the-frontline" target="_blank"> Field Ready</a> (Supporting Frontliners for COVID-19 Response Project) on mapping manufacturers'capabilities to promote local manufacturing. The project focus was specific for production of PPEs. The team at OpenStreetMap Uganda proposed to map manufacturing capabilities in other sectors such as construction materials, agricultural machinery, and bottling companies. Mapping local manufacturing companies will help to further promote local purchase of locally manufactured goods, because people in Uganda and Africa at large companies tend to import goods from outside the country. This Award was to support continuation of the manufacturer’s capabilities mapping.</p>

                                <h3>Actual Works</h3>
                                <p>OpenStreetMap Uganda geospatially mapped <b>manufacturers capabilities</b> around Kampala industrial Area, Namanve Industrial Park and other areas around Kampala and Greater Kampala. During this data collection exercise we targeted large, medium and small scale manufacturing facilities in order to <b>boost local manufacturing and supply</b>. We were able to collect data from over 400 manufacturers.<br><br>The project aimed at mapping out different manufacturers to determine their capabilities  based on their <b>equipment, inputs and number of products</b> produced per day. The data features included:-
                                    <ul>
                                      <li>The name, address and location of the manufacturing facility.</li><br>

                                <p>The DRC (Danish Refugee Council) GIS Dashboard is an initiative engineered under <a href="https://nuri.ag/" target="_blank"> Northern Uganda Resilience Initiative (NURI)</a> programme Which is one of the three development engagements under the Denmark Uganda Country programme 2018- 2022.<br><br> 

                                On the program, OpenStreetMap Uganda collaborated with Danish Refugee Council (DRC) to visualize the NURI project with the application of geospatial techniques to produce a web map and an atlas.<br><br>

                                The objective of NURI is being achieved through these strategic inventions:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Climate smart Agriculture.</li>
                                    <li>Rural Infrastructure (IR)</li> 
                                    <li>Water Resources Management (WRM).</li>
                                </ul>

                                The program was implemented in 13 districts in the West-Nile and Acholi sub regions: Arua, Madi-Okollo, Terego, Koboko, Nebbi, Zombo, Pakwach, Adjumani, Moyo, Obongi, Lamwo, Kitgum and Agago. Additionally, the project is benefiting both refugees and host communities in five refugee settlements: 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Rhino camp.</li>
                                    <li>Imvepi</li>
                                    <li>Palorinya </li>
                                    <li>Adjumani</li>
                                    <li>Palabek settlements.</li>

                                </ul>
                                Water Resources Management interventions were implemented in 8 microcatchments of; Yelulu, Ayila Abongo, Nyarwodho, Ora, Nyivura, Iboa, Ogwapoke and Awic. The created community assets include: <b>Food forest (FF), Community Access Roads (CAR), Green Roads for Water (GR4W), Water Ponds, Spring protection, Soil and water conservation(SWC)</b>.

                                <b>Dashboard (WebMap) and Atlas Objective</b>
                                The web map can be utilized in a couple of ways that  include:-
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Addressing the need for fast, easy access to multi-layered GIS data and tools for the purposes of planning and sustainability leveraging the data for the NURI program.</li>
                                    <li>Enable stakeholders and the public access to the results of the analyses, particularly outputs from the Rural Infrastructure and Water resources site-matching and suitability analysis.</li>
                                    <li>Offer advantages to project managers and donors, district local governments, such as quicker result generation, in depth analysis, convenience, and cost reduction.</li>
                                    <li>The WebMap is a promising decision support tool for Rural infrastructure and water resources management planning and management.</li>
                                </ul>

                                The NURI Project Dashboard and Atlas intended to give an overview about projects carried out under the NURI (Northern Uganda Resilience Initiative) program. That is giving details such as the status, which will enable all the stakeholders to engage and understand the impact of the work done on the program.

                                <p>The activities were covered in the months of May through to Mid July with a number of obstacles revolving around the pandemic COVID-19. A number of methodologies were deployed to achieve the success of the project.Tools deployed in the field included OpenDataKit, Kobotoolbox Server and excel spreadsheet. Means of transport used included a ferry to cross River Nile, Boda Bodas (Motorcycle), and Cars. Visualization softwares such as QGIS, Umap, and Google Data Studio were utilized to monitor progress and report on the field work.</p>

                                    <h6>Facebook Community Impact Microgrant</h6>

                                    <p>In July 2020, 15 municipalities in Uganda attained city status as a result of the ever-increasing population due to rural-to-urban migration. The new cities lack up-to-date geospatial information, limiting the effective extension and monitoring of services and settlement across these new cities. Information about road conditions, garbage collection, environmental degradation, and adherence to physical plans is not readily available to the city planners.<br><br>
                                    OpenStreetMap Uganda built upon its existing remote mapping efforts in the ongoing “mapping of the new cities initiative” by engaging the YouthMapper chapters and the general OSM community in a nationwide Mapillary campaign to generate over 100,000 new street-level images. These used to add more detailed road information to OpenStreetMap, such as data about street lights, road conditions, building heights, building materials and business information, that will be shared and used by the Ministry of Lands and city authorities to plan and monitor the new cities more effectively.</p>

                                <p>OpenStreetMapUganda in collaboration with OpenGIS Uganda worked with Noble Farms Uganda Limited, private agricultural training and inputs provider to introduce open mapping GIS  tools and technology to improve efficiency in their work.
                                <br><br>Noble Farms Uganda Limited provides farmers with inputs that include seeds, agricultural machinery like tractors, and training on post-harvesting. In order to effectively plan and target farmers' needs, Noble Farms with support from OSM Uganda and OpenGIS Uganda embarked on setting up <b>a farmer profile and needs a platform.</b> <br><br>The Farmer profile platform is a low-cost GIS platform that allows Noble farms to easily locate and monitor their farmers as well as identify their needs early enough. This allows stock the adequate amounts of  seeds and tools for the various agricultural seasons. The farmer profile platform also allows Noble farms to plan for effective delivery, maintenance, and monitoring of the agricultural equipment supplied and hired.<br><br>Farmers in remote and rural areas of Uganda face a huge challenge accessing quality seeds and agricultural inputs, the farmer profile platform in many cases eases the identification of farmers and allow easy location and tracking of farmers for noble farms Uganda ltd and other agricultural extension services providers to supply good quality seeds and agricultural inputs, this also in turn helps improve the farmer’s harvests and crop output.</p>

                                <h3>Project Desription</h3>
                                <p>In 2020, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) initiated the Uganda Domestic Resource Mobilization for Development (DRM4D) activity to support the Government of Uganda fast track and monitor its journey to self-reliance and increase domestic spending on health, education, agriculture, and other public services. The project commenced on January 21, 2020 and is expected to run through January 20, 2025. <br><br>The Domestic Revenue Mobilization for Development (DRM4D) Activity is designed to support improvements in revenue mobilization to fast-track Uganda’s journey to self-reliance and increase domestic spending on health, education, agriculture, and other public sector expenditure. The DRM4D Activity will build on previous initiatives in Local Government Revenue improvement by other development partners.<br><br>DRM4D, and other development partners came together  to support efforts leading to thecomprehensive digitization of revenue processes to enhance data integrity, revenue management, administration, and reporting.</p>

                                <p>In most cities in the world, property tax represents the highest percentage of the sources of revenue and it is where most of them acquire their revenue for development.
                                <br>In Uganda however, this hasn't been properly explored hence leading to low anticipated revenue collected. This is always due to:- 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Expired rolls being used</li> 
                                    <li>Most of them are actually  manual which makes them hard to administer</li>
                                    <li>Miss out on new properties that were never captured during the valuation</li>
                                    <li>Rolls are almost unusable because of the incomplete data</li>
                                    <li>Missing details of the new owners as a result of a change in ownership</li>
                                    <li>Properties in the newly extended/annexed areas of the cities had never been assessed for tax as required under the Local Government Rating Act </li>
                                    <li>Property valuation rolls were not GIS-enabled, which implies increased costs of revaluations after every five years.</li>
                                </ul>

                               Knight Frank Uganda Limited (Knight Frank) in association with OpenStreetMap Uganda (OSM Uganda) carried out data collection in four new cities; Mbarara, Masaka, Lira and Gulu in order to provide a GIS enable property valuation system that will be used by the city officials to do valuation with ease and accuracy in order to increase the domestic revenue.
                               <br><br>The tools used for data collection were highly automated and makes recording property information much easier and flexible, they can also be used to operate in remote places that have no internet connections. All the raw data was stored on the server and in case of any data losing situation, a backup will be available from this server.</p>

                               <h6>Objectives</h6>
                               <p>The main objective of this project is to increase revenue from property tax by conducting computerized property valuation with GIS-enabled property valuation rolls. Knight Frank’s goal will be to ensure that the entire assignment is executed in accordance with the client’s requirements as stipulated in the terms of reference, in a timely and cost-effective manner. The specific objectives for the assignment included;-
                               <ul>
                                   <li>To identify, locate, collect, and capture data on all property as defined under the Local Government Rating Act in cities for purposes of property taxation.</li> 
                                   <li>To assess rateable values on all property for determination of property tax.</li>
                                   <li>To support cities to determine amounts due and payable by property owners before the display of valuation lists.</li>
                                   <li>To produce GIS-enabled valuation lists covering all property in the city.</li>
                                   <li>To collect, update and digitize business licensing data and update respective registers.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>With support from the Response Innovation Lab and Save the Children, HOT and MapUganda carried out a project across Bidibidi Refugee Settlement in northern Uganda to better understand the state of energy-saving solutions available to refugees in the settlement as well as relevant market trends and challenges associated with accessing and purchasing these solutions.<br><br>In collaboration with refugees and host community members in Bidibidi, HOT and MapUganda led extensive data collection activities, gathering information from energy-saving solution retailers about where they purchased their products from, what their available stock consisted of, the biggest challenges they faced in selling these products to the refugee and host populations and much more.<br><br>

                                Upon completion of the data collection exercise, the information was analyzed and compiled into maps and graphs to support a better understanding of the accessibility and availability associated with purchasing energy-saving solutions in the settlement. Information products and raw data were shared with the AMPERE consortium - a group of implementing partners working to enhance access and adoption of energy-saving solutions across the settlement - to support more targeted efforts in enhancing clean energy product use, linking potential customers with the clean energy market and increasing awareness of such products amongst refugees and respective host community members.</p>

                                <h3>Project Description</h3>

                                <p>The general objective of the training was to train Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) officers how to fly, capture, process and  analyse the images to respond to disaster using drones.</p>

                                <p>For efficiency OpenStreetMap Uganda (under Uganda flying labs) was exempted from flying at altitude above 400m  above the ground.The flights were conducted in accordance with FAA standards and all the flights were  carried out below 400 feet.</p>

                                The training covered both the theory and practicals.  The training comprised of six modules which covered the following topics;  
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Introduction to drone operations in Uganda.</li>
                                    <li>Regulations and Code of Conduct.</li>
                                    <li>Meteorology</li>
                                    <li>Human factors and Aerodynamics</li>
                                    <li>Drone rotary parts and their uses </li>
                                    <li>Mission Planning using Pix4D</li>
                                    <li>Drone flying for aerial photography.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>An Area of not more than 10 Sqkm was surveyed in a village identified by UNDP  officials. The core purpose was to train participants on how to capture images using  drones while carrying out automatic flights.The participants were introduced to drone mission planning using the <a href="https://www.pix4d.com/" target="_blank"> Pix4D</a>. The  drone Pre planning checklists, Meteorology and Aerodynamics were among the topics  that were discussed in the theory session. The participants then went for the field  drone flying session. Each participant planned for a mission, captured the images of the areas of their  missions, with their flight altitude between 70m to 100m above the ground. All the  missions were double grid missions and automatic flights so that each participant  could capture a regular area of around 250 m by 250 m. This was to ensure that the  most appropriate resolution was acquired from the drone survey.</p>

                                 <img src="images/Participants in the field.png" alt="Participants in the field"><h6><i>Participants in the field.</i></h6>

                                <p>The aerial images were captured at 80% standard overlap. The participants also  repeated the session of assembling a drone and disassembling before and after  executing the mission plan respectively. The images were then extracted by the pilots  and shared with the participants on the day for the image analysis.</p>

                                <p>In conclusion there exists significant justifications for <a href="https://www.dronedeploy.com/" target="_blank"> drone deploy</a> in risk analysis and  humanitarian response in each country, although the specific reasons will vary by  country and project. From the training, the participants were able to identify that the general drone  regulations in the country are still lacking making the use of the technology be at stake.  Therefore, more attention must be given to the regulations of drones and must be  followed by any pilot. It was widely accepted in the training that there is a strong need  for more and better adaptive and diagnostic practice in flying drones for the  participants to deploy drones effectively for their humanitarian response. In summary, the training as a whole was a success in a way that all participant’s  expectations were met.</p>

                                <p>Timely provision of medical and non-medical supplies is critical for COVID-19 response, and the need to remember the undesirable demands to protect oneself from the disease has prompted the reinvention of risk communication with targeted messaging like the “Tonsemberera (Do not come close to me) campaign.” All over the world, the outbreak prompted the application of tools, such as digital and geospatial technology, for efficient responses, to enable the quick identification and isolation of infected individuals or families while also ensuring the efficient supply of daily needs such as food, especially among those that were gravely affected by the pandemic.</p>

                                <p>OpenStreetMap is one such platform that enables building tools and obtaining demographics without needing complex techniques. With the identification of buildings, access roads, and amenities, responders gain easy access to information, and so the planning and delivery of support services become more efficient.</p> 

                                <p>Unfortunately, the most affected areas in Uganda were the border districts that only existed as blank spots on OpenStreetMap. <b>MapUganda</b>, together with <b>Geo YouthMapppers</b>, came forward through the <b>HOT Microgrant</b> program to support the availability of data for the planning and actions of government and field responders, such as the Ugandan Red Cross. The parties embarked on mapping buildings, roads, and identifiable amenities for porous border entry points to help create detailed maps to support and retool the Ugandan Red Cross Society and Ministry of Health surveillance efforts against the spread of the pandemic.</p>

                                <p>In spite of the lockdown of the airport in March and the strict monitoring and testing at official borders entry points, COVID-19 transmission still found its way into the country through the porous border points, carried by people entering from the neighboring countries of Kenya, Congo, and Tanzania. With support from a Rapid Response Microgrant, students and community members dedicated a piece of their time every day to contribute to the remote mapping of 27 border towns.</p>

                                <h3>Data Collected</h3>

                                <p>A series of trainings and work sessions using different tools, such as JOSM, ID Editor, Tasking Manager, Quantum GIS, Umap platform, were used to remotely prepare the data and information for the communities at the frontline of the awareness and risk communications against the pandemic.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>More than 250,000 buildings were added to the map</li>
                                    <li>Over 7000km of roads were collected.</li>
                                    <li>More than 400km of waterways were also mapped in these all the border points.</li>
                                    <li>27 Digital and paper maps were created.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3>Insights from the mapped border towns</h3>
                                <p>Among all the 27 border towns, Kyotera and Busia had the highest number of buildings. The access roads are primarily distributed across Kyotera, Elegu, Busia, Mutukula, and Moyo border towns, with Kyotera having the highest number of access roads. This attributes to the dense population of the town and puts its population at risk of an outbreak if there is a community infection within the area.</p>
                                <ul>
